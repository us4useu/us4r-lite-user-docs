# Current system limitations

Here is a list current system limitations:

- Standard sampling frequency is 65MSPS. Sampling at 80MSPS requires a change of system firmware.
- SWE (Shear-Wave Elastography) functions are limited and available only to approved early-adopters.

The above limitations may be removed in future versions of the system software/firmware.
