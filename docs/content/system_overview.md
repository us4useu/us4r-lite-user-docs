# System Overview

## Principle of operation

The us4R-lite™ system is available in two interface versions:
1. model RL_2020 - features Thunderbolt-3 interface to connect to the external Host PC (notebook or desktop). The provided certified Thunderbolt-3 cable is to be used.
2. model RL_2021 - features an external PCIe interface to connect to the external Host PC (desktop). The provided certified PCIe cables and PCIe host adapter card (requires PCIe gen3 x8 slot) are to be used.

**The us4R-lite™ is a peripheral device thus always requires an external Host PC to work.**

Available ARRUS™ SDK is to be installed and run on the host PC to execute  User’s applications/scripting for configure the device, acquire data, and perform custom processing.
